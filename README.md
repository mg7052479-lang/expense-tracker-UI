# 💰 Expense Tracker App

A simple, clean, and beginner‑friendly **Expense Tracker** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This app helps you track your **income and expenses**, calculate totals, and understand where your money is going — all in real time.

This project is part of my journey into **web development** and focuses on strengthening core **JavaScript DOM manipulation and logic** skills.
